    <p>To make a positive impression at a book event, focus on sharing your personal connection to the book, highlighting its strengths, and expressing gratitude to those who helped bring it to life. Instead of just stating the book is good, explain why you enjoyed the writing or plot. Engage the audience with a thoughtful question or anecdote to spark conversationThe primary importance of reading books lies in their ability to introduce us to a world of wisdom and knowledge. For students, this translates into enriched brains, improved vocabulary, and enhanced writing skills.
